# Directory Tree viewer

A Python Tkinter application for browsing and visualizing directory structures in a tree format. This tool allows you to open a directory, navigate through its subdirectories, and search for specific files or directories within the structure.

## Overview

- **Open Directory:** Load any directory from your system to display its structure.
- **Tree View:** Visualize the directory hierarchy in a tree format with folders and files.
- **Navigation:** Easily move back and forward through previously visited directories.
- **Search:** Filter directories and files in the loaded tree by entering keywords.
- **Statistics:** View the total file count, directory count, and size of the directory contents.

## Usage

1. **Open Directory:** Click the "Open Directory" button to choose a directory.
2. **Directory Tree Display:** The selected directory structure will appear in a text area with directories highlighted in yellow.
3. **Navigation:** Use the **back** and **forward** buttons to navigate through your directory history.
4. **Search:** Type into the search box to filter and display only matching directories and files.
5. **Tree Interaction:** Click on any directory name within the tree to load its subdirectories directly.

## Directory Statistics

At the end of the tree view, the application displays:

- **Total files**
- **Total directories**
- **Total size** of all files in the selected directory
